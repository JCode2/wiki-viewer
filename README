About:
    A web application that allows a user to search anything they like using the input form.
    Once entered the user will have a list of "preview cards" displayed back to them related to their search.


Technologies used:  1. HTML
                    2. CSS
                    3. Bootstrap
                    4. Javascript
                    5. jQuery
                    6. Used AJAX requests with the Wikipedia API.
                    7. Originally used Babel along side the Javascript

What can be improved: 1. Mobile Responsiveness.
                      2. Allowing the user to hit the enter button instead of exclusively having to click the search button
